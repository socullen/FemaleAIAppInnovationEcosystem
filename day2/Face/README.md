# Face Recognition

‚è≤Ô∏è _est. time to complete: 30 min._ ‚è≤Ô∏è

## Here is what you will learn üéØ

In this challenge you will learn how to:

- how to create a Face API service in Azure
- how to connect you Face API service with your App
- how to pass the API key to you App using GitHub Secrets
- how to take a selfie üòâ

_API - Application Programming Interface: A software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other_

## Table of contents

## Getting started

The first step in creating our Face API is to create a new resource.

_Azure Resource: In Azure, the term resource refers to an entity managed by Azure. For example, virtual machines, virtual networks, and storage accounts are all referred to as Azure resources._

- Click the **+ Create a resource** on the home page
- Pick the category **"AI + Machine Learning"**
- Create a **Face** service.

## Create Face Cognitive Service

- Choose your **Subscription**
- Choose your **Resource Group** (A storage for multiple resources)
- Choose _West Europe_ as **Region** (Location of datacenter where the service is deployed)
- Create a **unique name** and select the **Standard S0 Pricing Tier**.

- Hit **Review + create** and than **Create**

## Integrate Face Service Credential into GitHub Secrets

The API key is a unique identifier, which we will add to our code. By doing so, we can connect our code to the API and perform API calls.

- Navigate to the _Face_ service in the Azure portal and there to _Keys and Endpoint_
- Copy the _Endpoint_ and the _Key_ into a notepad.

In Action Secrets you can store encrypted variables that you create in an organization, repository, or repository environment. These secrets are available to use in GitHub Actions workflows.

- Navigate to your GitHub repository's _Settings_, then to _Secrets_ and _Actions_
- Click on _New repository secret_
- Set the name to `VUE_APP_FACE_API_ENDPOINT`
- Set the value to your FACE service's endpoint: https://xxxxxxx.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
- Add the secret

  ![](./images/light/vue-app-face-api-endpoint-secret.png#gh-light-mode-only)

- Create another _New repository secret_
- Set the name to `VUE_APP_FACE_API_KEY`
- Set the value to your FACE service's key that should be a string of letters and numbers.
- Add the secret

## Run Frontend Pipeline again

- Navigate to _Actions_, than to your _pages_ workflow and hit _run workflow_.

- Wait a moment for your workflow to run and your changes to kick in. Click on the frontend link displayed under the deploy step under your pipeline `https://<yourGithubHandle>.github.io/...` or restart the App on your phone.

Our frontend application should now have a new button with a selfie ü§© symbol that allows us to take selfies and estimate how old we are.
These selfies will **not** be saved and will **not** appear on the timeline or News Feed.

## Take Selfies! How old are you really? Play around!

So go ahead and take at least 5 selfies and tell us how old you are in all of them.

Take also pictures of people who are around you and estimate their age, you might surprise them. üòÅ

That's a wrap for today! Congrats! ü•≥üôè

Now we will make our app understand when we talk üó£Ô∏è to our Milligram Social Media App.

## Overcharged? We got you covered

Ask your coach if you did not succeed. We have you covered with a back up. ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Use prepared Milligram Backend Service
